  Learning to Code: Practice Problems
</h1>

It is always a good idea to practice coding, no matter how advanced you think you may be. In this repository I plan on collecting practice problems, solving them to the best of my ability, and giving an explanation as to how one should arrive at the best solution.

Most of these problems will be taken from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). I occassionally may add other problems as well.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.

    Problem sets are seperated into individual folders. You can navigate to a folder and chose the language that you wish to work in. For algorithm type questions I will usually default to python for simplicity sake, but Java and C++ are the two other languages that I want to practice as well.

    Example:
    ```shell
    # enter a problem folder, chose a language, start problem solving
    cd TwoSum
    cd python
    ```
    
1.  Autopush to Git

    I included a bash script to auto-push to github. The commits are based off the current time rather than random messages. I find that to be more helpful. to use the script type: 
    
    ```shell
    ./gitpush.sh
    ```

## üßê Tips on Solving Coding Questions?

1.  **Practice**: Consisten practice is the best way to get better at solving questions.

2.  **Read the Question**: Read the question a few times. This is not the SAT's where you have to rush and finish questions in five minutes. Take your time, understand all parts of the question, and try to start thinking about the solution.

3.  **Brute-Force Solution**: You can almost always come up with a brute force solution to solve the question. This is not bad, it is just not time or space efficient. Try to get this solution for your own understanding, but continue to improve it. It may lead to the real solution.

4.  **Passes**: In general, the fewer passes you have to do over an array, a tree, etc., the better the solution is. Try to see if you can find a way to minimize the time complexity and space complexity. 


## üí´ Good Luck

Good luck, and have fun!
